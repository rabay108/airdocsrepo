Here's the info we've got for now.

IBMers must register at our official Red Hat site, and use their corporate card and expense that through their normal IBM expense reporting system.  But use the discount code to save at least $200.

- c. APAC : APACPA  (new IBM-specific code may be coming soon)
- d. ?  (new IBM-specific code may be coming soon)
- 3. If you register groups of 3 or more, then steeper discounts apply, and you should choose link on the right side of first page of registration that says ' Register a group ' :
- a. Group of 3-5
- b. Group of 6-9
- c. Group of 10+

Furthermore, we've collaborated with the BUY@IBM team and they've added this RH SKU purchase info to the opening WIKI page and to the pricebook page.

Another thing to note.  The prices go up the longer you wait to register.  These prices below are list prices, not necessarily the price you'll see.

- ● Earliest of birds (January 15-February 24): $1,099
- ● Early bird (February 25-March 19): $1,499
- ● Regular (March 20-May 22): $1,999

These are passes to the event only.  There is no travel or hotel included whatsoever.  Meals and snacks are provided for breakfast, lunch and breaks, with one or more evening events.  So you are on your own to book travel, hotel, etc. and expense those.    Not sure at all about lodging/hotels.  The event is in Boston, so shop around for best rates within reasonable distant to/from the event.
